The Python Script traverses to find phone numbers in both structured and unstructured text files. I used glob library to recursively traverse the directory and look for text files. I tried to cover most of the Indian and US phone number formats, since i have written a regex, the script can find all occurences of phone numbers in both structured and unstructured data. I tested my script on possible phone number formats and successfully extracted phone numbers out of them.
